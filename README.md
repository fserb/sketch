micro games
===========

This is a collection of micro games I've wrote.
Each game is a single haxe file that uses [ugl](https://github.com/fserb/vault/tree/master/vault/ugl).

They currently compile to Flash and Mac/Linux/Windows. I'm working on HTML5 compatibility.

Some of them are based on other games I've seen around.
